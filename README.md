# Collatz_Conjecture
this is an artistic Python program of the collatz conjecture: one of the most famous unsolved math equations; basically if x is even, divide by two, if x is odd, you should multiply by three and add one. At no point stop this until X reaches a steady state. Is there more then one steady state? *Needs python turtle library

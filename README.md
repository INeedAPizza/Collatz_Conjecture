# Collatz_Conjecture
this is an artistic Python program of the collatz conjecture: one of the most famous unsolved math equations. basically if x is even, divide by two, And if x Is odd, Now you shoulld multiply by three and add one. Continue doing this until X reaches a steady state. Is there more then one steady state? *Needs Python Turtle Library
